# Library Overview

## Question 1. Which Package did you Select
The library I chose was Turtle for python

## Question 2.What is the package/library
### 2a. What purpose does it serve?

Turtle offers a visual interface for users. It works as a drawing board and by using commands such as turtle.left(),turtle.forward() and turtle.right() we can move the turtle around. This can be used to make simple drawings but in more complex cases can graph out mathmatical functions like quadratic equations or the fibanacci sequence.

### 2b. How do you use it

I made a program that lets the user input a shape, color and size and the program will draw that shape then fill it in with that color. Turtle also allows us to have a GUI to accept user input which I also took advantage of. You can draw any of the following shapes, squares, circles, stars, triangles and a spiral and color them in with a variety of different colors. You can allow adjust the size of the shape by inserting the number of pixels you want it to be.

## Question 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?

> turtle.textInput

creates a GUI with a text input prompt.

_example: userInput = turtle.textinput("userInput", "Enter the what shape you would like the turtle to draw: ")_

> turtle.right(x) and turtle.left(x)

turns the cursor x degrees

_example: cursor.left(120) or cursor.right(90)_

> turtle.forward(x)

moves the cursor x amount of pixels

_example: cursor.forward(sizeInput)_

> turtle.fillcolor(x)

selects the color x to fill the shape with

_example: cursor.fillcolor(colorInput)_

> turtle.begin_fill(), turtle.end_fill()

fills in the shape with the color in turtle.fillcolor(x)

_example: cursor.begin_fill() and cursor.end_fill()_

## Question 4. When was it created?

The idea of a visual drawing board like Turtle goes back to the 1967 as it was part of the orignal Logo programming language used to teach kids programming, however it was offically added to python in version 2.5 in September 2006


## Question 5. Why did you select this package/library?

I'm a pretty artistic person so when I saw that Turtle lets you draw with programming I wanted to check it out. After checking out what it could do I instantly had a bunch of ideas for a project.

## Question 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?

This project really gave me a chance to go back to basics and focus on basic concepts like looping. With Turtle drawing out the loops to draw the shapes, it helped me visualize the errors better which I think we help me approach debugging differently.

## Question 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?

Turtle was a great library. I found it was pretty easy to pick up and work with and that learning the basics was easy but there was also more complex things you could do if you wanted. I had no issues getting the library working with is always nice as well!

### 7a. When would you recommend this package/library to someone?

I would recommend this to anyone who likes working with visuals/images when coding. 

### 7b. Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not?

Yes, during this exploration activity I had a bunch of ideas for other projects I could do.
